 ## core idea and Goal 
 >  The core idea is simple: To turn awareness about the boycott into a practical, daily choice.

 This is a fast, interactive quiz. You see a product, and you quickly decide: Is this product on the boycott list (Yes/No)?.

## Game Rules 
Upon starting the game for the first time, an initial popup window appears (often with an audio explanation) detailing the rules:
* Speed is Key: You must make a decision before the time bar under the logo runs out.
* The Objective: Answer (❌) if the product is on the boycott list, and (✔️) if it is not. 

 ## How to Play 
 * The game displays a logo and the name of brands. The player must make a fast decision:
   * Green Check : For products that ARE targeted by the boycott campaigns.
   * Red Cross : 
   For products that are NOT part of the boycott (national products or safe alternatives).
* Scoring: The player's score is calculated based on the speed and accuracy of their answers.
## Technologies Used
* **HTML :** Used for the game's structure and content display.

* **CSS :** Employed for styling, layout, responsive design, and animating the Timer Bar.

* **JavaScript :** The core language responsible for the game logic, timer functionality, score calculation, and handling user interaction/sound effects.

* **Git & GitHub :** Used for version control, project management, and deployment.
